            <td>Bleach is a more traditional adult anime that ran from 2004-2012 but is still ongoing to this day. The series follows Ichigo Kurosaki after he is bestowed with the powers of a Soul Reaper, a role similar to that of the Grim Reaper. He sets out to defend humans from evil spirits, all while guiding lost souls into the afterlife. Based on the best-selling manga of the same name by Tite Kubo, fans early on wondered how the anime would condense all the pages of filler.

                As it turns out, they didn't. <br>Instead, the series played it fast and loose with the source material by introducing characters and storylines not found in the Manga. While shows like this are notorious for bloated casts, each character in this series had their own ongoing storyline that was more adult-focused than others at the time. After a lengthy hiatus, Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, a direct sequel to the original anime series, came out just last year. The series hopes to close out the final arc of the Manga, though it may do just as well to deviate as it has in the past.</td>

            <td>A dark anime with a simple plot, Death Note can be as thought-provoking as it is gruesome. The story focuses on the absolute power to kill just about anyone with a name and a face. The power to do just this is bestowed on the owner of the Death Note. This series constantly makes the viewer question who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist throughout.

               <br> In fact, the anime might start off with the viewer rooting for Light Yagami, only to realize this character is filled with pure evil and is willing to use anyone close to him to achieve his dream of becoming a God of a new world. The ending, however, proves just how evil Yagami is. Death Note's reflections on certain ideologies, like what morality is, the debate on the death penalty, and the power of certain organizations and people, can be quite intriguing.</td>

Since then, a prequel movie called Jujutsu Kaisen Zero has also been released, and recently, the second season of the anime has also started releasing.

               <br> The main plot of the anime centers around a student named Yuuji Itadori, who, after swallowing the shriveled finger of a centuries-old curse named Sukuna, becomes a vessel for the ancient being. With the help of his friends and teachers, Itadori faces many other curses while everyone also struggles with their own personal problems and the past. The series gained a huge fandom in a very short time, making it one of the most-watched anime of recent times.</td>

            <td>A word of warning - this series is not for the faint of heart. Attack on Titan is a dark fantasy anime that is as devastatingly beautiful as it is heart-wrenching. Set in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by giant humanoid Titans, the series follows a group called the Survey Corps as they set out to protect themselves from these creatures... who may just be more like them than they realize. The main protagonist, Eren, joins the group after the brutal death of his mother at the hands of a Titan attack. Adapted from the manga by Hajime Isayama, this series certainly keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.

               <br> While Attack on Titan has been ongoing since 2013, the show is currently in its fourth and final season. Season Four, which began in December 2020, is set to conclude with Attack on Titan: The Final Chapters Special 2 later this year.

However, the trouble begins when the creator of a medieval fantasy game called Sword Art Online (SAO) traps thousands of players inside the game by removing the log-out button, leaving them stranded. The only way for these players to ever make it out to the real world again is to finish all the one hundred increasingly difficult levels of this game. The protagonist, Kirito, and the other players join forces to overcome the challenges.

               <br> The anime gained a lot of popularity due to its interesting plot and fantastic animation style. The action sequences of the show are also mind-blowing.
